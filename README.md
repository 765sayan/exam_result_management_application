# exam_result_management_application
**This project is an unfinished version of a student result management application. In this application there will be an administrator who can update all information about the examinees and also the examiners, the examiners can submit the marks given on each paper in this application based on which after the exam results of individual examinees can be published. I have tried to make it in core PHP and haven't been able to complete the project yet.**
